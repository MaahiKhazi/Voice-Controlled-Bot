# Bluetooth Controlled Toy Car with Voice Recognition

A toy car controlled using Bluetooth and Google voice recognition software. The code is written in Arduino.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino microcontroller
- Bluetooth module (e.g. HC-05)
- DC motor driver (e.g. L293D)
- DC motors for the car's wheels
- Power supply (e.g. 9V battery)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Google Voice Recognition library for Arduino
- A smartphone with Bluetooth capability

## Setup
1. Assemble the hardware according to the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
2. Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the code from the repository to the board.
3. Pair your smartphone with the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
4. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor and set the baud rate to 9600.
5. Use the commands "forward", "backward", "left", "right", and "stop" to control the car.

## Voice Control
1. The Google Voice Recognition library for Arduino is used to add voice control functionality to the car.
2. Connect an external microphone to the Arduino board.
3. Upload the code for the voice recognition feature to the board.
4. Speak the commands "forward", "backward", "left", "right", and "stop" to control the car.
